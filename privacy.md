# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated**: *October 21, 2024*

This Privacy Policy describes how EtchDroid ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses
your personal data when you use our application ("EtchDroid" or "the App"). We are committed to
protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal data is handled responsibly.

This Privacy Policy has been written to comply with
the [Google Play policies](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/113469#privacy)
and the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## In short

- **F-Droid Users**: When you download EtchDroid from F-Droid, no analytics, telemetry, tracking, or
  ads are included.

- **Other Sources (Google Play, GitHub releases, etc.)**: When downloaded from other sources,
  EtchDroid collects non-personally identifying telemetry data to help identify and fix issues.

Please read the detailed sections below for more information.

## Data Controller and Contact Information

The data controller responsible for your personal data is:

**Davide Depau**

Email: [privacy@etchdroid.app](mailto:privacy@etchdroid.app)

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please
contact us at the above email address.

## Where the App Was Downloaded From

The type and amount of data that EtchDroid processes depend on where the App was downloaded.

### F-Droid Store

If you downloaded EtchDroid from the F-Droid store:

- **No Data Collection**: EtchDroid does not collect or process any information about you or your
  device.
- **No Tracking**: There are no analytics, telemetry, tracking, or ads.
- **Source Separation**: We have separated all telemetry code from the rest of the App to ensure the
  F-Droid build fully respects your privacy. The F-Droid builds do not include any tracking code.

We rely on your help to troubleshoot and submit bug reports and issues. If you are unable to do
that, please download EtchDroid from another store so we can use crash reports to improve the App's
stability.

### Google Play, GitHub Releases, and Other Sources

If you downloaded EtchDroid from Google Play, GitHub releases, or any other source:

- **Data Collection**: EtchDroid uses the [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) telemetry service to help us
  identify stability issues and crashes.
- **Opt-Out Mechanism**: Telemetry is enabled by default based on our legitimate interest to improve
  the App. You can opt out of data collection at any time in the App's settings.

## What Information Does EtchDroid Collect?

We collect the following information:

- **Device Information**: Brand and family of your device (e.g., Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy).
- **Performance Information**: App startup times and performance events.
- **Usage Information**: Which buttons are pressed and which screens are displayed within the App.
- **Image File Names and Sizes**: File names and sizes of the disk images you open for writing.

  > **Note**: File names can sometimes contain personal data. We collect file names to help us
  troubleshoot issues with specific disk images. If you are concerned about this, you can opt out of
  telemetry in the App's settings.

- **USB Device Information**:
    - Device name.
    - Device vendor and product ID.
    - Device storage size.
- **App Screenshots**: Screenshots of the App where all text is censored. External views (such as
  the system file manager) are not captured. (Note that the App does not display any personally
  identifying information; screenshots are used for troubleshooting graphical issues.)
- **App Status Information**: Internal status of the App, such as ongoing jobs and their status.
- **Error Reports**: Any errors the App generates due to bugs or external issues such as
  disconnections or hardware problems.

## Why Does EtchDroid Collect This Data?

We collect this data to:

- Identify and fix problems with the App, such as handling of specific disk images, issues with
  specific hardware, crashes, and stability issues.
- Improve the performance and user experience of the App.

## Legal Basis for Processing

We process your personal data based on our **legitimate interest** to improve the App and provide a
better user experience. We have conducted a Legitimate Interests Assessment (LIA) to ensure that our
data processing does not override your rights and freedoms.

## Your Rights Under GDPR

If you are located in the European Union, you have the following rights regarding your personal
data:

- **Right of Access**: You can request access to the personal data we hold about you.
- **Right to Rectification**: You can request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal
  data.
- **Right to Erasure**: You can request that we delete your personal data.
- **Right to Restrict Processing**: You can request that we restrict the processing of your personal
  data.
- **Right to Data Portability**: You can request a copy of your personal data in a structured,
  commonly used, and machine-readable format.
- **Right to Object**: You can object to the processing of your personal data based on our
  legitimate interests.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us
at [privacy@etchdroid.app](mailto:privacy@etchdroid.app).

## Opt-Out of Data Collection

You can opt out of telemetry data collection at any time:

1. Open the App's menu.
2. Toggle the "Send anonymous telemetry data" setting to disable telemetry.

When telemetry is disabled, the App will no longer collect any data about your device or usage.

## Data Retention

We retain the collected data for up to **90 days**, after which it is automatically deleted. This
retention period allows us to analyze issues and improve the App's stability.

## Data Transfers

We store and process your data within the European Union. We use Sentry, which processes and stores
data within the EU, ensuring compliance with GDPR. If any data is transferred outside the EU, we
ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, such as Standard Contractual Clauses.

## Data Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or
disclosure. This includes encryption in transit and at rest.

## Use of Data Processors

We use Sentry as a data processor to collect and process data on our behalf. We have a Data
Processing Agreement (DPA) with Sentry, ensuring that they comply with GDPR and protect your
personal data.

For more information about Sentry's privacy practices, please visit
their [Privacy Policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/)
and [Data Processing Agreement](https://sentry.io/legal/dpa/).

## No Automated Decision-Making

We do not use automated decision-making or profiling in our App.

## Children's Privacy

Our services are not intended for individuals under the age of **16**, and we do not knowingly
collect personal data from children.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by
updating the date at the top of this policy and, where appropriate, by other means such as in-app
notifications.
